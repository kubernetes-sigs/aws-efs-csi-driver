# Troubleshooting

### Log collector script

The log collector script will collect  
- output of `kubectl describe pod <driver_pod_name> -n kube-system`
- output of `kubectl get pod <driver_pod_name> -o yaml -n kube-system`
- efs-utils logs from `/var/log/amazon/efs`
- efs-utils state files from `/var/run/efs`
- nfs mounts on filesystem

You can run the log collector as follows:  
```
python3 log_collector.py --driver-pod-name <driver_pod_name>
# for example
python3 log_collector.py --driver-pod-name efs-csi-node-7g8k2
```

However, before running the log collector, you may want to enable debug logs for both the csi driver and [efs-utils](https://github.com/aws/efs-utils), 
which is the mounting utility used by the driver.

After enabling debug logging using the following sections and before collecting logs,
make sure to attempt the mount again, so that new failure logs are acquired.

### Enable debug logging for efs csi driver
Modify the deployment manifests to use the new logging level with the following command from 
deploy/kubernetes or charts directory (depending on your installation method):  
`find . -type f | xargs sed -i '/v=2/s//v=5/g'`  

You will need to redeploy the driver after running this command.

### Enable debug logging for efs-utils
- `kubectl exec <driver_pod_name> -n kube-system -it /bin/bash`
- From inside the pod, `sed -i '/stunnel_debug_enabled = false/s//stunnel_debug_enabled = true/g' /etc/amazon/efs/efs-utils.conf`
- From inside the pod, `sed -i '/logging_level = INFO/s//logging_level = DEBUG/g' /etc/amazon/efs/efs-utils.conf`

### Advanced debugging (optional)
Capture traffic from the pod where failure is occurring:  
`tcpdump -W 30 -C 1000 -s 2000 -w nfs_pcap_$(date +%FT%T).pcap -i any -z gzip -Z root 'port 2049 or (src 127.0.0.1 and dst 127.0.0.1)'`

Capture operating system log data from the pod where failure is occurring:  
`cat /var/log/message > kernel_debug.log`
