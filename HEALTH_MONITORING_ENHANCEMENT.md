# Enhanced Health Monitoring Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the health monitoring enhancements implemented for the AWS EFS CSI Driver, addressing the Kubernetes ecosystem need for "health probe logic modernization to support readiness/liveness checks via the CSI health monitor."

## Overview

This implementation modernizes the basic health probe logic in the AWS EFS CSI Driver to provide sophisticated mount health monitoring, preventing pod crash-loops when EFS mounts degrade and providing better observability for production deployments.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Comprehensive Mount Health Monitoring (`pkg/driver/health_monitor.go`)

**Purpose**: Real-time monitoring of EFS mount points with actual I/O testing

**Key Features**:
- **Mount Registration**: Automatic tracking of mount points during volume operations
- **I/O Health Checks**: Performs actual write/read/verify operations to test mount accessibility
- **Configurable Intervals**: 30-second check intervals with 5-second timeouts (configurable)
- **Error Tracking**: Consecutive error counting and detailed error logging
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: Concurrent access protection with proper locking
- **Lifecycle Management**: Graceful start/stop with context cancellation

**Core Methods**:
- `RegisterMount()` / `UnregisterMount()`: Mount lifecycle management
- `GetMountHealth()`: Individual mount status retrieval  
- `GetOverallHealth()`: Aggregate health status for all mounts
- `GetHealthSummary()`: Detailed health information for all mounts

### 2. Enhanced HTTP Health Endpoints (`pkg/driver/health_server.go`)

**Purpose**: Multiple health endpoints for different monitoring needs

**New Endpoints**:
- `/healthz` - Overall health check (backward compatible)
- `/healthz/ready` - Strict readiness check (all mounts must be healthy)
- `/healthz/live` - Lenient liveness check (only fails if monitoring system broken)
- `/healthz/mounts` - Detailed JSON status of all mount points
- `/metrics` - Prometheus-compatible metrics

**Response Examples**:
```json
{
  "/var/lib/kubelet/pods/abc123/volumes/efs-pv/mount": {
    "mountPath": "/var/lib/kubelet/pods/abc123/volumes/efs-pv/mount",
    "isHealthy": true,
    "lastCheckTime": "2025-01-11T15:30:45Z",
    "responseTimeMs": 15,
    "errorCount": 0,
    "consecutiveErrors": 0,
    "lastError": ""
  }
}
```

### 3. Prometheus Metrics Integration

**Metrics Exposed**:
- `efs_mount_health_status`: Health status per mount (1=healthy, 0=unhealthy)
- `efs_mount_response_time_ms`: Response time for health checks
- `efs_mount_error_total`: Total error count per mount
- `efs_csi_driver_healthy`: Overall driver health status

### 4. Driver Integration

**Modified Files**:
- `pkg/driver/driver.go`: Added health monitor initialization and lifecycle management
- `pkg/driver/node.go`: Integrated mount registration/unregistration in volume operations
- `pkg/driver/identity.go`: Enhanced CSI Probe() method with health monitor integration

**Integration Points**:
- Health monitor started in `Driver.Run()`
- Mounts registered in `NodePublishVolume()`
- Mounts unregistered in `NodeUnpublishVolume()`
- CSI probe enhanced with health status awareness

## Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suite (`pkg/driver/health_monitor_test.go`)

**Test Coverage**:
- Mount registration/unregistration functionality
- HTTP endpoint responses and status codes
- Overall health aggregation logic
- Detailed mount health reporting
- Start/stop lifecycle management
- Health summary generation

**Test Results**: All tests pass, including existing driver functionality

## Production Benefits

### 1. Prevents Pod Crash-Loops
- Detects mount degradation before application failures
- Provides early warning through readiness probe failures
- Allows Kubernetes to avoid scheduling on unhealthy nodes

### 2. Enhanced Observability
- Detailed mount health metrics for monitoring systems
- Response time tracking for performance analysis
- Error pattern detection for troubleshooting

### 3. Graceful Degradation
- Lenient liveness checks prevent unnecessary driver restarts
- Strict readiness checks ensure healthy mount points
- Configurable timeouts for different operational requirements

### 4. Monitoring Integration
- Prometheus metrics for alerting and dashboards
- JSON endpoints for automated health assessment
- Backward compatibility with existing monitoring

## Configuration

Environment variables for customization:
- `HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL`: How often to perform health checks (default: 30s)
- `HEALTH_CHECK_TIMEOUT`: Timeout for individual health checks (default: 5s)
- `HEALTH_PORT`: Port for health endpoints (default: 9910)

## Documentation

**Created**:
- `docs/enhanced-health-monitoring.md`: Comprehensive user and operator guide
- `HEALTH_MONITORING_ENHANCEMENT.md`: Implementation summary (this document)

**Includes**:
- Kubernetes probe configuration examples
- Grafana dashboard queries
- Prometheus alerting rules
- Troubleshooting guides
- Migration instructions
